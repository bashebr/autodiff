# autodiff
# This is a diff tool in django between two files. These files are considered to be some CMS files, for example two drupal versions
so that a developer can easily maintain or create a patch between any two files.
So, first, user is asked to give the desired versions of the applications needed to compare.
Then the program checks the applications if they are already downloaded or not, then depending on the result, it tries to make ad diif.
